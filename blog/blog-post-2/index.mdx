After Clifford's puppyhood and upbringing in the city, the Howards move to Birdwell Island to accommodate for Clifford's large size.
In the suburbs, Clifford makes two new friends- Cleo, a small poodle, and T-Bone, the sheriff's bull terrier.
Clifford is an outgoing and friendly dog, who loves to help his friends in their times of need. 
Often times, Clifford lands in conflicts of his own due to his overtrusting nature, and his friends help him resolve them. 
On Birdwell Island, Emily Elizabeth and her new neighborhood friends do plenty of work to promote social welfare on the island.
