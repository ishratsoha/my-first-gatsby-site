Emily Elizabeth Howard adopted Clifford from her neighbor's litter of puppies in her apartment building.
Clifford was adorable when he was a small puppy and would always go on adventures with Emily Elizabeth while sititng in her backpack. 
He had many friends in the apartment building including Daffodil the bunny, Jorge the dachshund, and Norville the bird.
Emily Elizabeth and her family gave Clifford so much love and affection that he grew too big to live in the city.
Once Clifford became a big red dog, the Howards moved from the city to the suburbs of Birdwell Island to make sure Clifford had plenty of space.
